The main goal of a PCA analysis is to identify patterns in data; PCA aims to detect the correlation between variables.
 
If a strong correlation between variables exists, the attempt to reduce the dimensionality only makes sense.
 
In a nutshell, this is what PCA is all about:

Finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project it onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the information.

I've used a Superconductivity dataset in this code.

This dataset has a total of 21263 rows.

There are a total of 82 columns with 81 features and 1 target variable.
